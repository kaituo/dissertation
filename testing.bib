Local data structure invariants are asserted over a bounded fragment
                  of a data structure around a distinguished node M of
                  the data structure. An example of such an invariant
                  for a sorted doubly linked list is "for all nodes M
                  of the list, if M $\neq$ null and M.next $\neq$ null, then
                  M.next.prev = M and M.value $\leq$ M.next.value." It has
                  been shown that such local invariants are both
                  natural and sufficient for describing a large class
                  of data structures. This paper explores a novel
                  technique, called Krystal, to infer likely local
                  data structure invariants using a variant of
                  symbolic execution, called universal symbolic
                  execution. Universal symbolic execution is like
                  traditional symbolic execution except the fact that
                  we create a fresh symbolic variable for every read
                  of a lvalue that has no mapping in the symbolic
                  state rather than creating a symbolic variable only
                  for inputs. This helps universal symbolic execution
                  to symbolically track data flow for all memory
                  locations along an execution even if input values do
                  not flow directly into those memory locations. We
                  have implemented our algorithm and applied it to
                  several data structure implementations in Java. Our
                  experimental results show that we can infer many
                  interesting local invariants for these data
                  structures.
